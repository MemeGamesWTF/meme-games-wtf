              Welcome to our world! üéÆ‚ú® We're not just a game dev studio‚Äîwe're a
              wild mix of Millennials and Gen Z hardcore gamers who've been
              leveling up in the industry for the past six years. Stuck in the box
              for too long, we decided it's time to break free and do something
              epic.
            </p>
            <p className="abt7">
              Fueled by an ‚Äúitch-you-can't-scratch‚Äù kind of idea (and a sprinkle
              of Elon Musk inspiration), we asked ourselves: What if we turned
              trending memes into bite-sized, insanely fun Web 3 games? Minimal
              mechanics, maximum fun‚Äîthat's our vibe!
            </p>
            <p className="abt7">
              Our mission? To create quick bursts of joy, make people smile (even
              if just for a few seconds), and grow alongside the community.
            </p>
            <p className="abt7">
              But wait, there's more! We're not just about the games‚Äîwe're
              building an entire ecosystem. As gamers and developers ourselves, we
              take this opportunity seriously (like, super seriously). Let's
              change the game together! üöÄ
            </p>
            <p className="abt7">
              And hey, if you're dreaming of a wild meme game, we've got you! We
              even take payments in $WTF‚Äîbecause why not keep it iconic?
